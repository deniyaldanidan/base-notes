# Base-Notes

> Not Finished. Will continue after some time

started building this project to tryout `NextAuth + Drizzle + Mysql`. And authentication is done & I'll be able to protect routes. Thought of building this is as simple plain-text based note-taking app but after acheiving what i wanted to achieve I'll changed my mind and decided to build a Note-taking app with `Rich text` support.
